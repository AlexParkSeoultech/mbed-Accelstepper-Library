/// \mainpage mStepper library for MBED
///
/// This is modified AccelStepper library for MBED.
/// https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/index.html
/// It provides an object-oriented interface for dir/step driver like DRV8825
/// Based on the Arduino AccelStepper library by Airspayce.com
/// Translated for MBED by Alex Park  07-2019
///
/// \par Theory
///
/// This code uses speed calculations as described in 
/// "Generate stepper-motor speed profiles in real time" by David Austin 
/// http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MIT/961.09/projects/i0/Stepper_Motor_Speed_Profile.pdf
/// with the exception that AccelStepper uses steps per second rather than radians per second
/// (because we dont know the step angle of the motor)
/// An initial step interval is calculated for the first step, based on the desired acceleration
/// On subsequent steps, shorter step intervals are calculated based 
/// on the previous step until max speed is achieved.

/// \class mStepper mStepper.h <mStepper.h>
/// \brief Support for stepper motors with acceleration etc.
///
/// This defines a single 2 or 4 pin stepper motor, or stepper moter with fdriver chip, with optional
/// acceleration, deceleration, absolute positioning commands etc. Multiple
/// simultaneous steppers are supported, all moving 
/// at different speeds and accelerations. 
///
/// \par Operation
/// This module operates by computing a step time in microseconds. The step
/// time is recomputed after each step and after speed and acceleration
/// parameters are changed by the caller. The time of each step is recorded in
/// microseconds. The run() function steps the motor once if a new step is due.
/// The run() function must be called frequently until the motor is in the
/// desired position, after which time run() will do nothing.
///
/// \par Positioning
/// Positions are specified by a signed long integer. At
/// construction time, the current position of the motor is consider to be 0. Positive
/// positions are clockwise from the initial position; negative positions are
/// anticlockwise. The current position can be altered for instance after
/// initialization positioning.
///
/// \par Caveats
/// This is an open loop controller: If the motor stalls or is oversped,
/// mStepper will not have a correct 
/// idea of where the motor really is (since there is no feedback of the motor's
/// real position. We only know where we _think_ it is, relative to the
/// initial starting point).
///
/// \par Performance
/// The fastest motor speed that can be reliably supported is about 4000 steps per
/// second at a clock frequency of 16 MHz on Arduino such as Uno etc. 
/// Faster processors can support faster stepping speeds. 
/// However, any speed less than that
/// down to very slow speeds (much less than one per second) are also supported,
/// provided the run() function is called frequently enough to step the motor
/// whenever required for the speed set.
/// Calling setAcceleration() is expensive,
/// since it requires a square root to be calculated.
